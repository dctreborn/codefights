// Consider the following operation on a string containing digits from 1 to 9:

//     if the leftmost digit of the string is divisible by 3, remove it from the string;
//     otherwise, if the rightmost digit of the string is divisible by 3, remove it from the string;
//     otherwise, if the sum of two digits on the sides of the string is divisible by 3, remove both digits from the string;

// This operation is applied sequentially until the string is empty or neither of the three given conditions is met.

// For a given string find the result of applying the given algorithm to it.

// Example

// For s = "312248", the output should be
// truncateString(s) = "2".

// Here's how the answer is obtained:

//     3 is divisible by 3 and should be removed ("12248");
//     neither 1 nor 8 is divisible by 3, but their sum is, so both digits should be removed ("224");
//     neither 2 nor 4 is divisible by 3, but their sum is, so both digits should be removed ("2");
//     the resulting string "2" doesn't meet any condition, so it is the final answer.

// Input/Output

//     [time limit] 4000ms (js)

//     [input] string s

//     Guaranteed constraints:
//     1 ≤ s.length ≤ 15.

//     [output] string

function truncateString(s) {
    let a = s[0], len = s.length - 1, b = s[len], z;
    
    z = a % 3 == 0 ? s.substring(1) :
        b % 3 == 0 ? s.substring(0, len) :
        (a + b) % 3 == 0 ? s.substring(1, len) : s;
    
        return z == s ? z : truncateString(z);
